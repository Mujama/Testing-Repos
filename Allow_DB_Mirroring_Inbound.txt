Allow a Database Mirroring Endpoint to Use Certificates for Inbound Connections:


1.Create a login for other system.
2.Create a user for that login.
3.Obtain the certificate for the mirroring endpoint of the other server instance.
4.Associate the certificate with the user created in step 2.
5.Grant CONNECT permission on the login for that mirroring endpoint



1. Create a login for the other system. --On Server_A

	USE master;  
	CREATE LOGIN HOST_B_login   
  	 WITH PASSWORD = 'Strong_Password12';  
	GO  

To view the logins on this server instance, you can use the following Transact-SQL statement:
SELECT * FROM sys.server_principals 

2.Create a user for that login.
	USE master;  
	CREATE USER HOST_B_user FOR LOGIN HOST_B_login;  
	GO  
To view the users on this server instance, you can use the following Transact-SQL statement:
SELECT * FROM sys.sysusers;


3.Obtain the certificate for the mirroring endpoint of the other server instance.

4. Associate the certificate with the user created in step 2.
The following example, associates the certificate of HOST_B with its user on HOST_A.

	USE master;  
	CREATE CERTIFICATE HOST_B_cert  
   	AUTHORIZATION HOST_B_user  
   	FROM FILE = 'C:\HOST_B_cert.cer'  
	GO
To view the certificates on this server instance, use the following Transact-SQL statement:
	SELECT * FROM sys.certificates

5.Grant CONNECT permission on the login for the remote mirroring endpoint.
For example, to grant permission on HOST_A to the remote server instance on HOST_B to connect to its local login—that is, to connect to HOST_B_login—use the following Transact-SQL statements:

	USE master;  
	GRANT CONNECT ON ENDPOINT::Endpoint_Mirroring TO [HOST_B_login];  
	GO 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USE master;  
--On HOST_B, create a login for HOST_A.  
CREATE LOGIN HOST_A_login WITH PASSWORD = 'AStrongPassword!@#';  
GO  
--Create a user, HOST_A_user, for that login.  
CREATE USER HOST_A_user FOR LOGIN HOST_A_login  
GO  
--Obtain HOST_A certificate. (See the note   
--   preceding this example.)  
--Asscociate this certificate with the user, HOST_A_user.  
CREATE CERTIFICATE HOST_A_cert  
   AUTHORIZATION HOST_A_user  
   FROM FILE = 'C:\HOST_A_cert.cer';  
GO  
--Grant CONNECT permission for the server instance on HOST_A.  
GRANT CONNECT ON ENDPOINT::Endpoint_Mirroring TO HOST_A_login  
GO
