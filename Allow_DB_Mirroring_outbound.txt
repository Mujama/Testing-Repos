Setting up Database Mirroring:

1. In the master database, create a database Master Key.
2.In the master database, create an encrypted certificate on the server instance.
3.Create an endpoint for the server instance using its certificate.
4.Back up the certificate to a file and securely copy it to the other system or systems.

1. create the database Master Key using the following Transact-SQL command:

CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'Strong_Password';  
GO

2.In the master database, create an encrypted certificate on the server instance to use for its outbound connections for database mirroring.

USE master;  
CREATE CERTIFICATE HOST_A_cert   
   WITH SUBJECT = 'HOST_A certificate for database mirroring',   
   EXPIRY_DATE = '11/30/2013';  
GO 


3.Ensure that the database mirroring endpoint exist on each of the server instances.

	SELECT name, role_desc, state_desc, connection_auth_desc, encryption_algorithm_desc   
   	FROM sys.database_mirroring_endpoints;
If no endpoint exists, create an endpoint that uses this certificate for outbound connections and that uses the certificate's credentials for verification on the other system.

CREATE ENDPOINT Endpoint_Mirroring  
   STATE = STARTED  
   AS TCP (  
      LISTENER_PORT=7024  
      , LISTENER_IP = ALL  
   )   
   FOR DATABASE_MIRRORING (   
      AUTHENTICATION = CERTIFICATE HOST_A_cert  
      , ENCRYPTION = REQUIRED ALGORITHM AES  
      , ROLE = ALL  
   );  
GO  


4. Back up the certificate and copy it to the other system or systems. This is necessary in order to configure inbound connections on the other system.
BACKUP CERTIFICATE HOST_A_cert TO FILE = 'C:\HOST_A_cert.cer';  
GO;

   WITH SUBJECT = 'HOST_B certificate for database mirroring',   
   EXPIRY_DATE = '11/30/2013';

      AUTHENTICATION = CERTIFICATE HOST_B_cert

   );  
GO  
--Backup HOST_B certificate.  
BACKUP CERTIFICATE HOST_B_cert TO FILE = 'C:\HOST_B_cert.cer';  
GO   
--Using any secure copy method, copy C:\HOST_B_cert.cer to HOST_A.
